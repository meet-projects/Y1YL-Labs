## Building a Basic AI Chatbot in Python

**Objective:** Your task is to program a simple AI chatbot in Python using fundamentals such as dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements and functions.
*Important Note: this is a much simpler chatbot than the ones you might be using(Gemini,ChatGPT..), those chatbots do not operate on a dictionary and they use more advanced logic than the one we will rely on.

**Instructions:**
1. Expand the chatbot to:
    - Respond to yes/no questions (e.g., “Are you hungry?”)
    - Handle edge cases with try/except
    - Give different responses based on user input
    - make sure your menu is updated with all the actions that the chatbot can do.
      
2. **Bonus**
   -Spell out all accepted variants for each possible response (including synonyms, abbreviations, or informal forms).
   This depends on your responses dictionary.
   -For example:
       “tell me a joke” → {“joke”, “tell a joke”, “laugh”, “tell me a joke”}
       “yes” → {“y”, “yes”, “yeah”, “sure”}
       “no” → {“n”, “no”, “nope”}

  **Make sure you have all of the requirements below before moving on**
- Use of dictionaries which will tell the bot what to respond to the user input.
- Use a loop to keep the chatbot running until the user decides to exit.
- Handle cases where the user enters unrecognized input.
- Use of a menu to make sure whoever uses your chatbot knows what features it has.
- Use of at least one library.



2. **Extending the Chatbot (Bonus)**
   - Add more responses to improve the chatbot's conversational abilities.
   - Consider adding conversation history.
   - If the chatbot does not know how to handle an input, it should ask the user for clarification or suggest adding a response.
   - Ensure that the chatbot understands user input even if it is not written exactly as in the `responses` dictionary.

**Good luck with your chatbot programming! Feel free to seek help from online resources or refer to external tools, but be prepared to explain your code line by line.**
