# Y1 Yearlong 2025/26 - individual Project
## Building a Basic AI Chatbot in Python

**Objective:** Your task is to program a simple AI chatbot in Python using fundamentals such as dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements and functions.
*Important Note: this is a much simpler chatbot than the ones you might be using(Gemini,ChatGPT..), those chatbots do not operate on a dictionary and they use more advanced logic than the one we will rely on.

**Instructions:**
1. Expand the chatbot to:
    - Respond to yes/no questions (e.g., “Are you hungry?”)
    - Handle edge cases with try/except
    - Give different responses based on user input
    - make sure your menu is updated with all the actions that the chatbot can do.
      
2. **Bonus**
   - Spell out accepted variants: yes → {“y”,“yes”,“yeah”,“sure”}, no → {“n”,“no”,“nope”}. 

  **Make sure you have all of the requirements below before moving on**
- Use of dictionaries which will tell the bot what to respond to the user input.
- Use a loop to keep the chatbot running until the user decides to exit.
- Handle cases where the user enters unrecognized input.

# After you're done with everything from the previous sessions you can move on to this section:    
1. **Choose your own Library**
   - We talked about Libraries in the summer(Examples for libraries:Turtle,Random)
   - This is your chance to get creative, choose at least one feature from the [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcPuJOgiokcIU_ED68-UK9Qwu7wZdXfEe14PPovoev4/edit?usp=sharing), and research the most appropriate library to implement the feature
      and incorporate it in your code!
   - check out [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzhI12m9k3GM7Ouq23P5Tb_vQCR2a1wq19tKfOe9dqo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.stt3o5wpb2vc) if you need extra help with using the libraries
   - (you can research and choose other features but get it approved by your instructors first!) 

2. **Extending the Chatbot (Bonus)**
   - Add more responses to improve the chatbot's conversational abilities.
   - Consider adding conversation history.
   - If the chatbot does not know how to handle an input, it should ask the user for clarification or suggest adding a response.
   - Ensure that the chatbot understands user input even if it is not written exactly as in the `responses` dictionary.

**Good luck with your chatbot programming! Feel free to seek help from online resources or refer to external tools, but be prepared to explain your code line by line.**
