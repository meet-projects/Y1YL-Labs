## Building a Basic AI Chatbot in Python

**Objective:** Your task is to program a simple AI chatbot in Python using fundamentals such as dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements and functions.
*Important Note: this is a much simpler chatbot than the ones you might be using(Gemini,ChatGPT..), those chatbots do not operate on a dictionary and they use more advanced logic than the one we will rely on.

**Instructions:**
1. **Writing the Main Chat Loop**
   - Use a `while` loop to keep the chatbot running until the user decides to exit.
     - If the user enters "exit" the program should stop.
     - Include more than one "phrase" to exit the program; "bye","exit","stop"...
   - The chatbot looks up the user's input in the `responses` dictionary and provides a response if it finds a match.
     - Hint: use `input()` function to receive user input.
     - Make responses case-insensitive, meaning that the program considers "HELLO" and "hello" and "HellO" as the same input.
     - Add menu of options (e.g., "Ask me a question", "Tell me a joke", etc.) to make your chatbot more user friendly.
   
2. **Choose your own Library**
   - We talked about Libraries in the summer(Examples for libraries:Turtle,Random)
   - This is your chance to get creative, choose at least one feature from the [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcPuJOgiokcIU_ED68-UK9Qwu7wZdXfEe14PPovoev4/edit?usp=sharing), and research the most appropriate library to implement the feature
      and incorporate it in your code!
   - check out [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzhI12m9k3GM7Ouq23P5Tb_vQCR2a1wq19tKfOe9dqo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.stt3o5wpb2vc) if you need extra help with using the libraries
   - (you can research and choose other features but get it approved by your instructors first!)
  
     
3. **Bonus**
   - Add key recognition - Hint: look up `in`.
   - Look up **Recursion**, what is it?, try to understand the logic behind it and check out examples.
        *note: we only want you to explore it and try to understand it, using it is not required in this project.
     
**Good luck with your chatbot programming! Feel free to seek help from online resources or refer to external tools, but be prepared to explain your code line by line.**
