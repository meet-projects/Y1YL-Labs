## Building a Basic AI Chatbot in Python

**Objective:** Your task is to program a simple AI chatbot in Python using fundamentals such as dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements and functions.

*Important Note: this is a much simpler chatbot than the ones you might be using(Gemini,ChatGPT..), those chatbots do not operate on a dictionary and they use more advanced logic than the one we will rely on.

# Session 1

**Instructions:**
1. **Understanding the Basics // Predefined Responses**
   - A dictionary will act as our "database" meaning we will store and retrive information/data from it, we will start with it being static and as we progress we will make it more and more dynamic.
   - Basic AI chatbots work as a dictionary, where you build a dictionary of user input as keys and map them to AI responses as values. It may look something like this:
     ``python
     responses = {
         "hello": "Hello! How can I assist you?",
         "how are you": "I'm just a computer program, but I'm here to help!",
         "goodbye": "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
         # Add more responses here
     }
     ``
     
  2. let's make the chatbot dynamic!
    - take the user's name and age(don't lose them we will use them later!)
    - Calculate and show the user what's their age in months, weeks, days, minutes or seconds.(feel free to do all of them!)
    - make the chatbot dynamic: whenever you run your code and have to enter a question, it should show the user's name, when you run your code it should look something like this:
        ```terminal
           Sam:hello
           ChatBot:Hello! How can I assist you?
         
  -  Test you code out, does each key co-respond to it's value
  -  *note: this is just one way to make the chatbot dynamic, think of other ways, other information that you can take from the user and use.
  -  Add more responses to your dictionary to cover more questions.

**Bonus:**
- Use AI to generate 3 fun greetings and select one randomly (Uses list + random())

**Good luck with your chatbot programming! Feel free to seek help from online resources or refer to external tools, but be prepared to explain your code line by line.**
