### **Objective:**  
In this project, you and your partner will design and code your own *interactive story engine* — a text-based world that reacts to the player’s choices.  
You’ll use **dictionaries**, **lists**, and **loops** to model a world, track a player’s state, and let users explore and make decisions that shape the outcome.  

This project builds directly on your chatbot experience — but this time, you’re creating a *mini game engine* where **data and logic** work together.

##  Session 2 


###  Step 1: Create Your Player Dictionary  
*Note: this can also be stord in a json file like you did with the **`world.json`**

```python
player = {
    "location": "forest",
    "inventory": [],
    "name: : ""
}
```

*you can add more pairs of key-value to this according to the world you're building and the information you want to store about the player.

###  Step 2: Add a Game Loop  

- make sure you update the location of the player.
- make sure you don't have an **infinte loop**.
- handle wrong input/input thay doesn't exist.


---

### Step 3: Add Inventory Features  
- Let the player collect or drop items, let the program rememmber those items.
- Use loops to display the player’s inventory:


 **By the end of Session 2:**  
You should have a **playable prototype** — players can move, interact with scenes, and pick up or drop items.
