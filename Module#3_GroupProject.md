##  Group Project 2025/26

###  What Are You Building?

You are building a **real website** that:

* Has a **Python backend**
* Has an **AI-generated front-end**
* Solves a **real problem teenagers face**

The website must:

* Have **at least 3 pages**
* Use **Python functions YOU wrote**
* Follow a **clear and consistent design** based on your wireframe

---

##  Step 1: Choose a Problem

Your group will choose **one real problem** from one of these areas:

* Friends & family
* Community (city)
* School / education
* World

### Possible Problems You Can Choose From

* Time management and procrastination
* Balancing school, family, hobbies, and rest
* Digital distractions (phone, social media, internet)
* College preparation confusion
* Stress, low energy, emotional overload
* Healthy habits (sleep, exercise, food)
* Understanding personal values
* Friendship misunderstandings
* Managing personal money
* Speaking up, sharing ideas, presenting

 Your job is to:

1. Understand the problem deeply
2. Find the **root problem**
3. Design a **practical tool or solution**

---

##  Step 2: Create a Wireframe

A **wireframe** is a simple visual plan of your website.

It must show:

* All pages
* Page layout
* Buttons
* Forms
* Inputs and outputs
* Where Python is used

 Your design must be **consistent across all pages**.

---

##  Step 3: Write the Planning Document

This document explains **how your project works**.

It must include:

* The problem and your solution
* Role division (who does what)
* The **main feature** of the website
* What data is saved in **JSON**

### Data Flow (Very Important)

You must explain this clearly:
**User input → Python → JSON → Output**

---

##  Step 4: Backend Code (Python + JSON)

###  JSON File

Your JSON file is your **database**.

It must be able to:

* Store data
* Retrieve data
* Update data
* *(Optional)* delete data

---

### 🐍 Python Functions

Your backend must include these functions:

Required:

* `load_data()` → reads data from JSON
* `save_data()` → saves data to JSON

Main Feature Function:

* One function that solves the problem
  (for example: add a task, report a complaint, add an item, do a calculation)

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Build the Website (Using AI)

Your website:

* Has **at least 3 pages**
* Is **generated using AI**
* Each page must use **your Python functions**
* Matches the **wireframe**
* Uses a **consistent design theme**

---

## ⭐ Bonus (Optional)

* Use **API keys**
