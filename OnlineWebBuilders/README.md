# Y1 Yearlong 2021/22 - Online Web Builders

This lab will be dedicated to your work, effort and progress in CS, all the way along the Y1 yearlong.
After this lab, you will have your own **portfolio**, that you can use later on to showcase your work, ideas and projects. 
<br><br>
A portfolio is a collection of materials that show cases your skills, qualifications, education, training and experiences. It provides insight into your personality and work ethic.
