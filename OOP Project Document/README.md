# Backend Individual Project - Object Oriented Programming 

> DEADLINE: TO BE SUBMITTED BY  - [SUBMIT HERE]()

## SWBATs - Students will be able to
- Create **minimum viable products** backend program that fully supports and is based on the **Frontend project** that was done in the 1st semester.
- Understand the magic of backend and how it works.

## Motivation / Why Should You Care? 
- You have learned **frontend** already, now it's time to do the **backend** part and understand the difference between them.
- Usually, we as developers start off with **backend**, and then move on to the visual part; We have reversed the order like this to enhance your learning experience and make it easier for you to connect the dots. 
- In Y2 Summer - You will learn how to combine **backend** with **frontend** and have complete pure **website applications!** (With databases!)


## Objective & Minimum Requirements
Your objective is to create a **backend** version of your 1st semester projects, using **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **pure python**.
* Your application should run in the terminal.


**Minimum Requirements:**
- Your application should be an MVP of your Frontend 1st semester group project! 
- Have at least **2 classes** built using **OOP**. 
    - *If you don't have such repetitive item/feature: **think of how to implement a new class/feature that serves the purpose**.
    - It can be: `users` class to log in,  or any item that is repeated and used frequently in your website!
    - Keep in mind also its functions/methods - for example: a `user` is able to `login`,`change password`,`change name`...etc. All of these will be the `functions/methods` of your `class`.
- Have a `while` loop - that keeps your application running until instructed by the user to stop/exit.
- Have `instructions` print every time you start your application.
    - Include a brief explanation of what is the purpose of your application, and what are the controls to use it/ how is it used.
    - The instructions can also include a introduction, something like: "Welcome to [name of the website]"... and then show the instructions.
- Have at least **1 feature** that makes your project unique!
    - Since you'll have 3-4 other projects that are similar created by your team members from the 1st semester project.
 

 
### Extra points for:
- **Creative design!** You're creating an application in the terminal, which might make it not so fun to see/use... add your own design whether it is using [Turtle Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) or other visual python libraries.
- A super clear **user experience!** The **MVP Backend** version of your project should be easy to use and navigate, and very clear to the user.


## Workflow:

#### Planning:
1. Pull up your Front-end group project from the 1st semester - 
    - Try to identify (and write down) as many potential **classes** as possible for your MVP.
    - After coming up with a list of potential classes, decide on **at least** 2 main classes, that your application depends on. (Or are very major parts of your application's idea)
    - Now think about (and write down) the attributes (the values) that each class will have, as well as the functions/methods they do!

2. Write down the storyboard of how you want your application to act - 
    - What is the first thing a user sees when running your program?
    - How can you navigate between your "screens" and control your program?
        - For example: think about how the user would go from the first thing s/he sees when the program runs, to another section/feature in your website, navigating between different parts of your website/program.
        - In other words, think about the commands that will control your program and what they do!
    - Keep in mind the user experience.
    
#### Implementation:
3. Start with laying out the classes and their functions/methods you have planned in `Step 1`.
    - Don't forget to test it out every time you add something.

4. Continue to implementing the infinite `while` loop - 
    - Your program should keep running until the user instructs otherwise. 
    - Think about how you want your user to be able to exit. (Is it by typing "exit"? Is it by typing something else?)
    - Everytime you're done with a certain function/method/feature, you should wait for the user's input again:
        - *Hint*: Look up `input()` or `raw_input()`.

5. Write out the `instructions` print - it can be stored in a function for easier reusability!
    - The instructions are part of the UX, they should be very clear to the user how the application can be used.
    


## Conclusion / So What?
- You are currently creating your very first **MVP Back-end** project!
- You can bring in your frontend project from the 1st semester, and by comparing both - understand what it means to have an **MVP**, and how much progress you can get to from an MVP to a fully developed idea! 
- You are on your way to build a lot of amazing web applications in the Y2 Summer! (Including **databases**; They are based on OOP)

## Hints and Hurdles
- If you get stuck on coming up with potential classes, let us know and we'll help in the brainstorm!
