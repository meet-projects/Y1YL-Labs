## SWBATs - Students will be able to
- Create **minimum viable products** backend program that fully supports and is based on the **Frontend project** that was done in the 1st semester.
- Understand the magic of backend and how it works.

## Motivation / Why Should You Care? 
- You have learned **frontend** already, now it's time to do the **backend** part and understand the difference between them.
- Usually, we as developers start off with **backend**, and then move on to the visual part; We have reversed the order like this to enhance your learning experience and make it easier for you to connect the dots. 
- In Y2 Summer - You will learn how to combine **backend** with **frontend** and have complete pure **website applications!** (With databases!)
