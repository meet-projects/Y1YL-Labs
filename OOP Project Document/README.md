# Backend Project - Object Oriented Programming [Work in Progress]

> DEADLINE: TO BE SUBMITTED BY  - [SUBMIT HERE]()

## SWBATs - Students will be able to
- Create **minimum viable products** backend program that fully supports and is based on the **Frontend project** that was done in the 1st semester.
- Understand the magic of backend and how it works.

## Motivation / Why Should You Care? 
- You have learned **frontend** already, now it's time to do the **backend** part and understand the difference between them.
- Usually, we as developers start off with **backend**, and then move on to the visual part; We have reversed the order like this to enhance your learning experience and make it easier for you to connect the dots. 
- In Y2 Summer - You will learn how to combine **backend** with **frontend** and have complete pure **website applications!** (With databases!)


## Objective & Minimum Requirements
Your objective is to create a **backend** version of your 1st semester projects, using **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **pure python**.
* Your application should run in the terminal.


**Minimum Requirements:**
- Have at least **2 classes** built using **OOP**. 
  - *If you don't have such repetitive item/feature: **think of how to implement a new class/feature that serves the purpose**.
  - It can be: `users` class to log in,  or any item that is repeated and used frequently in your website!
  - Keep in mind also its functions - for example: a `user` is able to `login`,`change password`,`change name`...etc. All of these will be the `functions/methods` of your `class`.
- Have a `while` loop - that keeps your application running until instructed by the user to stop/exit.
- Have a `introduction` every time you start your application.
 - The introduction can be something like: "Welcome to [name of the website]"
 - And include a brief explanation of what is the purpose of it, and the controls to use it.

 
### Extra points for:
- **Creative design!** You're creating an application in the terminal, which might make it not so fun to see/use... add your own design whether it is using [Turtle Library](TBD), [Colorama]() or other visual python libraries.
- A super clear user experience! The **MVP Backend** version of your project should be easy to use and navigate, and very clear to the user.
