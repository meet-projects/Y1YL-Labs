# Backend Individual Project - Object Oriented Programming 

> DEADLINE: 31st October, To be presented at HalloConf - [SUBMIT HERE](https://forms.gle/Y3SaM2fxHfo5SrmDA)  

## SWBATs - Students will be able to
- Create a backend program that is based on any social media website. (For example: Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, etc.)
- Experience with and have better understanding of what backend is and how it works.

## Motivation / Why Should You Care? 
- In CS, there is **backend**, and there is **frontend**. Everything you have learned so far is **backend**, and now it's time to implement the latest addition (OOP) in order to have a better understanding of application structures. 
- Usually, developers/programmers start off with **backend**, and then move on to the visual part. We will do just that! You will learn about **frontend** in the coming sessions of the yearlong.
- **Backend** programming is what makes all programs, websites or applications work! It is the basically the engine. It is critical to understand it first before we move on.  

## Objective & Minimum Requirements
Your objective is to create a **backend** program that is based on any social media website, using **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **python**.
* Your application should run in the terminal. (The terminal is the black window with white text)

  
  
### Minimum Requirements:
- Your application should have at least **2 classes** built using **OOP**. 
    - It can be: `users` class to log in, `posts` class,  or any item that is repeated and used frequently in your website!
    - Keep in mind of what functions/methods you want to include in your project - for example: a `user` is able to `login`,`change password`,`change name`...etc. Another example is a `post` that has `number of likes` or `comments` - All of these will be the `functions/methods` of your `class`.
- Have a `while` loop - that keeps your application running until instructed by the user to stop/exit.
- Have `instructions` print every time you start your application.
    - Include a brief explanation of what is the purpose of your application, and what are the `commands`/`keywords` to use it. (How is it used?)
    - The instructions can also include an introduction, something like: "Welcome to [name of the website]"... and then show the instructions.

 

 
### Extra points for:
- **Creative design!** You're creating an application in the terminal, which might make it not so fun to see/use... add your own design whether it is using [Turtle Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html), [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) or any other visual python libraries.
- A super clear **user experience!** The **Backend program** should be easy to use and navigate, and very clear to the user.
- Have at least **1 feature** that makes your project unique!
    - Since you will all work on a the "back-end of a social media website", there might be similar projects. Think of how you can set your project apart!

  
  
## Workflow:

#### Planning:
1. Choose the social media platform you will build using OOP - 
    - Try to identify (and write down) as many potential **classes** as possible for your program.
    - After coming up with a list of potential classes, decide on **at least** 2 main classes, that your application depends on. (Or are very major parts of your application's idea)
    - Now think about (and write down) the attributes (the values) that each class will have, as well as the functions/methods they do!

2. Write down the storyboard of how you want your application to act - 
    - What is the first thing a user sees when running your program?
    - How can you navigate between your "screens" and control your program?
        - For example: think about how the user would go from the first thing s/he sees when the program runs, to another section/feature in your website, navigating between different parts of your website/program.
        - In other words, think about the commands that will control your program and what they do!
    - Keep in mind the user experience.
    
#### Implementation:
3. Start with laying out the classes and their functions/methods you have planned in `Step 1`.
    - Don't forget to test it out every time you add something.

4. Continue to implementing the infinite `while` loop - 
    - Your program should keep running until the user instructs otherwise. 
    - Think about how you want your user to be able to exit. (Is it by typing "exit"? Is it by typing something else?)
    - Everytime you're done with a certain function/method/feature, you should wait for the user's input again:
        - *Hint*: Look up `input()`.

5. Write out the `instructions` print - it can be stored in a function for easier reusability!
    - The instructions are part of the UX, they should be very clear to the user how the application can be used.

## Hints and Hurdles
- If you get stuck on coming up with potential classes, let us know and we'll help in the brainstorm!
