> First things first, go to your `Sublime` in your computer and open it.

## Instructions:
You will need two HTML pages in this website, `index.html` & `about.html`.  
So let us create the **About page** and the **Index page**. 
1. Click on **`Add file`** then name it `Index.html`, click on **`Add file`** again but this time name it `about.html`
Then copy this code structure and past it into `index.html` and`about.html`:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>

  <title></title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1 >my first webpage!</h1>
 

</body>

</html>

3. Create a simple **navigation tool** by using the **`<a>`** tag, this allows us to jump from the **Home page** to the **About page**. Now do the same thing to get from the **About page** to the **Home page**.  
  
4. Use the `<h1>` tag to create a header to your pages.    
5. Now add the products of your liking to your store using the **`<h2/3/4..>`** tags to give them a name and write a short description about them.    
6. The next step is adding an image for the products (by using an **`<img>`** tag) that when clicked on it will lead you to the product's page on Amazon, eBay, etc...(by using an **`<a>`** tag).  
`*Note: Make sure that your images are saved in the same folder as your code.`.   
7. For the final step, add a short description of your online shop in the **About page**.      

## Bonus:
Get your imagination going and think of even more creative ways to improve your website!  
Few Suggestions: Separate pages for different products, A Navigation Bar and much more!!!    
**Good luck & Do your best!  
Remember to show your wonderful work to your partners and instructors so we can learn from each other.**
