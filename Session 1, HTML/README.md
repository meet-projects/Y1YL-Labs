> First things first, create a new Repl.it account if you haven't already! Here are [instructions](https://github.com/meet-projects/Y2-Seminar2020-Labs/blob/master/replit-setup.md) to help you set up!
**Open a new Repl, select `HTML, CSS, JS` as the Language, call it `HTML Lab1`, and write/upload your final code there :D**

## Instructions:
You will need two HTML pages in this website, `index.html` & `about.html`.  
The **Index page** is already there, so let us create the **About page**.  
1. Click on **`Add file`** then name it `about.html`.  
Then copy the code structure from `index.html` and paste it into `about.html`.    
2. Create a simple **navigation tool** by using the **`<a>`** tag, this allows us to jump from the **Home page** to the **About page**. Now do the same thing to get from the **About page** to the **Home page**.  
  
3. Use the `<h1>` tag to create a header to your pages.    
4. Now add the products of your liking to your store using the **`<h2/3/4..>`** tags to give them a name and write a short description about them.    
5. The next step is adding an image for the products (by using an **`<img>`** tag) that when clicked on it will lead you to the product's page on Amazon, eBay, etc...(by using an **`<a>`** tag).  
`*Note: Make sure that your images are saved in the same folder as your code.`.   
6. For the final step, add a short description of your online shop in the **About page**.      

## Bonus:
Get your imagination going and think of even more creative ways to improve your website!  
Few Suggestions: Separate pages for different products, A Navigation Bar and much more!!!    
**Good luck & Do your best!  
Remember to show your wonderful work to your partners and instructors so we can learn from each other.**
