# Group Projects - Front End (HTML, JS, CSS)

> DEADLINE: TO BE SUBMITTED BY 26/01/2023 - On Repl.it

## SWBATs - Students will be able to
- Understand the brainstorming and design process and decide on an idea for any future project.
- Work in a Team of 4, and split into pairs of 2s, and divide responsibilities amongst themselves.
- Build web applications combining front-end programming with using Javascript as back-end.
- Understand all of the code that is written, aiming towards better understanding in CS.

## Motivation / Why Should You Care? 
The point of this project is to learn to build web applications, combining front-end programming with using Javascript as back-end programming, but you can't build an application about nothing. You need a good idea, first!  
Building this project will help you understand and have more of an idea of how to code the backend side (Which will make it much easier to learn during the Y2 Summer), allowing you to create a fully functional website on a more advanced level!


## Objective & Minimum Requirements

Create a *dynamic* web application that provides a solution to a problem that exists in on of these four categories:
1. Friends & Family
2. School
3. Community
4. The World

**Minimum Requirements:**
- At least 1 Main Input/Output functionality.
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  
 
### Extra points for:
- Use of Bootstrap
- Use of Three.js
- Storyboard
- Wireframe


## Workflow:
- Problem brainstorming:
  - On a zoom board, create four categories: Friends and family, School, Community, World.
  - Students should write down as many ideas as possible on post-it notes for three minutes for each of the following segments:
      - What are some problems you experience with your friends or family?
      - What are some problems you experience at school?
      - What are some problems you experience in your community (city)?
      - What are some problems you want to address in the world?
      
  - Following each segment, start removing some of the ideas you like less than the others. 
      - You can start circling your best 3-5 ideas and remove the rest.
  - Finally, do the same actions until you are left with 1 idea.
  
- Solution brainstorming:
  - Once you agree on the problem, start thinking about who your end-user will be. Who are you building this app for? How do you currently solve this problem? What are the shortcomings of current solutions?
  - Take 3 minutes to write down as many solutions to you groups problems as possible individually.
  - Take an additional 3 minutes to share and refine ideas.
  - Come together, share ideas and pick your favorite solution. (An effective way can be to remove the ideas you would give up on until you are left with 1-3 ideas and agree on one of them)
- After coming up with an idea for the project, each team should get approval by an Instructor to make sure the idea is not repeated and is valid.
- Design wireframes and create a storyboard (~10mins).
- Get to building the project!



## Conclusion / So What?
You're on your way to becoming a master coder! But no programmer knows everything there is to know about programming. There is **ALWAYS** more to learn. Figure out what it is about coding that you love, and dig as deep as you can into that topic to better understand it. If you love Javascript, grab a book on it or read the documentation to learn how exactly Javascript works under the hood. If you want to build up your Python skills, find a website that lets you practice with tricky algorithmic problems. The resources are boundless, so keep on learning!


## Hints and Hurdles
- Don't spend too much time deciding over an idea, it should be had in the first session, as you don't have all the time in the world for this project.
  - Focus on how to create your minimum viable product (meaning: your project but without any additional features), and then you can start adding the extra stuff.
- Don't hesitate to approach your CS team for help, guidance, feedback, ANYTHING!
